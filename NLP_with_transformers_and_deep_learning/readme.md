This an <b>NLP that utilizes transformers pipelines and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) for training our dataset found in the our data.
So what the code does is that, it basically trains our dataset using RNN specifically the encoder-decoder method to convert english texts to the corresponding french text
and we had a 95% accuracy score after the training and embedded the code to work on a graphic display called Gradio which is used to demonstrate our code.
